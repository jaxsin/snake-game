## Big Picture

The big picture of the project. Ultimately what this could be.

## First Round

What I hoped to accomplish on the first round in about 2 weeks.

## Test Plan for 1st round

Detailed tests for test user to follow, and/or function that can be unit tested.  For example:
>The user is prompted to enter an English phrase. 
>User enters "Hello". 
>The program prints "Nihao"


## Reflections and revisions

How did it go? Do you have changes to the big picture?

## Next steps

What do I hope to accomplish in the next round?
