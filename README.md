Big Picture
My big picture is a snake game. I want to get a snake to eat food and If the snake gets more food, you can get more points. Also you can control the snake to make some patterns or make some pictures. 
   
First Round
In the first two weeks, I will try to use a  keyboard to control the snake to make it work. I will also use the right arrow key to make the snake turn right and I will use the left arrow key to make it turn left. I will use the up arrow key to make the snake move up and the down arrow key to make it go down. The squares are the food and the snake needs to catch the food, and food appears randomly everywhere.
   
Test Plan for 1st round
The squares appear in different places.
During this time, you can move the snake in different directions.
When all of the squares appear on the screen, you can try to control the snake by moving it any direction you want.
Try to control the snake to eat all of the food. 
   
Reflections and revisions
It is pretty difficult to get the food. It is hard to coordinate controlling the snake with getting the food. 
Another problem is it is difficult to be clear which way left and right actually is. The keyboard is confusing when it translates to the screen.  If the direction of the snake is opposite to the direction of the keyboard, it is difficult to distinguish the direction of the snake from the keyboard.
   
Next steps:
For the first problem, we need to only change the 10 and 100 digits and the single digit of the coordinate is always zero.
And for the second problem, if you want to turn right or go straight, you can just use your keyboard.  When I fix the keyboard, You can use the left arrow to not just turn left but move toward the general left direction. Itâ€™s the same with the right arrow, the down arrow and the up arrow.
